* Migrating to doxyYoda

This guide covers migrating your Doxygen project to use the doxyYoda theme.

** From Default Doxygen Theme

*** Step 1: Obtain doxyYoda

**** Via GitHub Action (recommended for CI)
#+begin_src yaml
- uses: HaoZeke/doxyYoda@v0.1.0
  with:
    cppreference-tag: true   # optional
#+end_src

**** Via release tarball
Download the latest release from [[https://github.com/HaoZeke/doxyYoda/releases][GitHub Releases]] and extract it alongside your =Doxyfile=:
#+begin_src bash
curl -LO https://github.com/HaoZeke/doxyYoda/releases/download/v0.1.0/doxyYoda_0.1.0.tar.gz
tar xf doxyYoda_0.1.0.tar.gz
#+end_src

**** Via git clone (for development)
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/HaoZeke/doxyYoda
cd doxyYoda
pixi run compile   # or: sass src/styles/scss/main.scss src/styles/doxyYoda.css
#+end_src

*** Step 2: Update your Doxyfile

Add or update these settings:

#+begin_src conf
# -- doxyYoda theme settings --
HTML_HEADER            = doxyYoda/html/header.html
HTML_FOOTER            = doxyYoda/html/footer.html
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxyYoda/css/doxyYoda.min.css
LAYOUT_FILE            = doxyYoda/xml/doxyYoda.xml
#+end_src

If using the git clone (not the release tarball), the paths differ:
#+begin_src conf
HTML_HEADER            = doxyYoda/src/html/header.html
HTML_FOOTER            = doxyYoda/src/html/footer.html
HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxyYoda/src/styles/doxyYoda.css
LAYOUT_FILE            = doxyYoda/src/xml/doxyYoda.xml
#+end_src

*** Step 3: Remove conflicting settings

If your =Doxyfile= has any of these custom settings, remove or comment them out as doxyYoda provides its own:

#+begin_src conf
# Remove these if present -- doxyYoda handles them
# HTML_STYLESHEET        = ...          # doxyYoda uses HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET instead
# HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = ...          # Solarized palette via CSS custom properties
# HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = ...
# HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = ...
#+end_src

*** Step 4: Recommended Doxyfile settings

These settings work well with doxyYoda but are not strictly required:

#+begin_src conf
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = NO            # Tree view has limited support (see readme)
DISABLE_INDEX          = NO
SEARCHENGINE           = YES
HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES
SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
INLINE_SOURCES         = YES
#+end_src

If you use MathJax, doxyYoda ships with MathJax 3 support:
#+begin_src conf
USE_MATHJAX            = YES
MATHJAX_VERSION        = MathJax_3
#+end_src

** From m.css

If you are migrating from [[https://mcss.mosra.cz/][m.css]]:

1. *Remove m.css configuration*: delete the =Doxyfile-mcss= or any =conf.py= / =m.css= specific files
2. *Switch back to standard Doxygen*: m.css uses its own Python-based build pipeline; doxyYoda works directly with =doxygen Doxyfile=
3. *Update your Doxyfile*: follow the steps above for default Doxygen migration
4. *Note on markup*: m.css uses custom =@m_class= and =@m_div= commands that Doxygen will ignore. These can be left in place (they'll be silently skipped) or removed at your convenience

** From Doxygen Awesome

If you are migrating from [[https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css][doxygen-awesome-css]]:

1. *Replace stylesheets*: swap =doxygen-awesome.css= (and any sidebar/darkmode extensions) for the doxyYoda files
2. *Replace header/footer*: if you had custom =HTML_HEADER= / =HTML_FOOTER= for doxygen-awesome, replace them with doxyYoda's
3. *Remove extra JS*: doxyYoda bundles its own dark mode toggle and code-copy functionality, so remove any =doxygen-awesome-darkmode-toggle.js=, =doxygen-awesome-fragment-copy-button.js=, etc.
4. *Update Doxyfile*: follow the steps in the default migration section above

** Common Pitfalls

- *=HTML_STYLESHEET= vs =HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET=*: doxyYoda uses =HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET=. Setting =HTML_STYLESHEET= will replace Doxygen's default CSS entirely, which doxyYoda builds upon. Make sure you use =HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET=.
- *Doxygen version*: doxyYoda requires Doxygen >= 1.12. Check with =doxygen --version=.
- *Tree view*: =GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES= has limited support due to Doxygen's jQuery-based resize logic. See the [[file:readme.org][readme]] for details.
- *Font loading*: doxyYoda loads fonts from Google Fonts and Hack via CDN. If your documentation is served in an environment without internet access, fonts will fall back to system defaults.
